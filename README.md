# The CasaMare README

What is the difference between a house and a home? A home is yours.

CasaMare is a website to help you find your way home that is suited to your needs. You can find a home to rent or buy in all 50 states filtered out by location, price, number of beds and baths. Nothing is out of reach.

The index page is laid out with a map to the left and the home listing on the right. The map has markers that correspond to the listing latitude and longitude and are clickable to open the home show modal. The listing features home items that show images, information and an associated save button for the home. Clicking on the home item will also open a home show modal.

The home show modal contains a header with save button and edit/delete buttons if the home owner is the current user. The website also allows for the creation of new home by clicking the sell button, allowed only by a logged in user. Logged in users may also see saved homes listings.

CasaMare is the portal to your future home. Let us help you find your way because a home is not just a place, it's a feeling. Welcome home.
